I spent over 100 hours exploring and still found new things. The difficulty may turn off some players, and the story can be sparse at times, but the sense of discovery is unmatched. As a long-time fan of FromSoftware, this is their best work yet. If you loved Dark Souls 3 or The Witcher 3, you'll love this.`,
      reviewSummary: 'Elden Ring offers a vast, challenging world with rewarding exploration and combat. Best for fans of FromSoftware, but the difficulty and sparse story may not appeal to everyone.'

      transcript: `The Witcher 3 sets a new standard for RPGs. The story and world are incredible, and the quests are some of the best I've played. However, there are still bugs even after patches, and the combat can feel clunky. If you value story and world-building, this is a must-play. I recommend it to fans of Elden Ring and Red Dead Redemption 2. I do tend to prefer story-driven games, so keep that in mind.`,
      reviewSummary: 'The Witcher 3 is a must-play for story lovers, with an incredible world and quests, but bugs and clunky combat hold it back. Recommended for those who value narrative over gameplay polish.'

I found myself fighting the same types of bosses over and over. Maybe it's just not for meâ€”I'm not a big fan of Soulslike games and prefer more accessible experiences. If you want a challenging game, go for it, but I recommend Breath of the Wild for a more welcoming adventure.`,

If you can get past the technical problems, you'll have a good time. If you want a more polished experience, try Cyberpunk 2077.`,
