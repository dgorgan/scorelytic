---

## Overview

This document outlines optimization and fixes for four major issues in our LLM pipeline:

1. Classic Game Badge Detection - Too literal matching
2. Bias Detection System - Either too strict or missing nuances
3. Sarcasm Detection - Too generic and static responses
4. Satirical Reviewer Classification - Too loose, flagging thoughtful reviews

---

## 1. Classic Game Badge Detection Issues

### Current Problem

The `isWellKnownClassicGame()` function in `sentimentService.ts` uses simple string matching against a hardcoded list:

- Matches "doom" → flags both classic Doom (1993) AND Doom: The Dark Ages (2024)
- Matches "zelda" → flags both Ocarina of Time AND Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (2024)
- No consideration of release dates, critical acclaim thresholds, or cultural impact timeframes

### Root Cause Analysis

```typescript
// Current implementation (lines 1444-1499 in sentimentService.ts)
const classicGames = [
  'zelda',
  'doom',
  'mario', // Too broad
  'breath of the wild', // 2017 game, not really "classic" yet
  'tears of the kingdom', // 2023 game, definitely not classic
];
```

### Proposed Solutions

#### Option A: Year-Aware Classic Detection

```typescript
const CLASSIC_GAMES_DATABASE = {
  // Franchise + specific year ranges for "classic" status
  zelda: {
    classics: ['ocarina of time', 'majora', 'wind waker', 'twilight princess'],
    modernClassics: ['breath of the wild'], // 2017, might qualify
    tooRecent: ['tears of the kingdom', 'echoes of wisdom'],
    classicCutoff: 2015, // Games before this year can be "classic"
  },
  doom: {
    classics: ['doom', 'doom ii', 'doom 3'],
    modernClassics: ['doom 2016', 'doom eternal'],
    tooRecent: ['doom the dark ages'],
    classicCutoff: 2010,
  },
};
```

#### Option B: Metacritic Score + Age Heuristic

```typescript
const isClassicGame = async (title: string, releaseYear?: number): Promise<boolean> => {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const gameAge = releaseYear ? currentYear - releaseYear : 0;

  // Must be at least 7 years old AND have high critical acclaim
  if (gameAge < 7) return false;

  // Check against curated list of games with proven legacy
  return PROVEN_CLASSICS.some((classic) => title.toLowerCase().includes(classic.toLowerCase()));
};
```

#### Option C: Cultural Impact Scoring

```typescript
const CULTURAL_IMPACT_METRICS = {
  'ocarina of time': { score: 95, yearsSinceRelease: 25, influenceRating: 10 },
  doom: { score: 90, yearsSinceRelease: 30, influenceRating: 10 },
  'doom the dark ages': { score: 85, yearsSinceRelease: 0, influenceRating: 2 },
};

const calculateClassicStatus = (title: string) => {
  const metrics = CULTURAL_IMPACT_METRICS[title.toLowerCase()];
  if (!metrics) return false;

  // Formula: (MetacriticScore * 0.4) + (YearsSince * 2) + (Influence * 5) > 85
  const classicScore =
    metrics.score * 0.4 + metrics.yearsSinceRelease * 2 + metrics.influenceRating * 5;
  return classicScore > 85;
};
```

### Recommended Implementation

**Hybrid Approach**: Year-based cutoff + curated exceptions

```typescript
const isWellKnownClassicGame = (title: string, releaseYear?: number): boolean => {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const lowerTitle = title.toLowerCase();

  // Hard cutoff: Nothing from last 5 years can be "classic"
  if (releaseYear && currentYear - releaseYear < 5) {
    return false;
  }

  // Curated list of games that have achieved classic status
  const PROVEN_CLASSICS = [
    // 1980s-1990s classics
    'super mario bros',
    'zelda',
    'ocarina of time',
    'majora',
    'doom',
    'quake',
    'half-life',
    'final fantasy vii',

    // 2000s classics (now 15+ years old)
    'halo',
    'grand theft auto san andreas',
    'world of warcraft',
    'bioshock',
    'portal',
    'mass effect',

    // Early 2010s (10+ years, proven legacy)
    'skyrim',
    'dark souls',
    'minecraft',

    // Exclude: 'breath of the wild', 'tears of the kingdom', 'doom eternal'
  ];

  return PROVEN_CLASSICS.some((classic) => lowerTitle.includes(classic));
};
```

---

## 2. Bias Detection System Issues

### Current Problem

According to the user, only 1 out of 20+ reviews shows detected bias (IGN Dragon Age), and only because of explicit keyword matching ("as a non-binary person myself"). The system appears either:

- Too conservative (high confidence thresholds)
- Missing subtle bias patterns
- Insufficient keyword coverage

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 2A: High Confidence Thresholds

```typescript
// In biasAdjustment.ts, confidence calculation may be too strict
const confidenceScore = calculateBiasConfidenceScore(...);
// Current filtering (line 1085 in sentimentService.ts):
biasesDetected = biasesDetected.filter(
  (b) => (b.confidenceScore >= 0.2) && b.evidence.length > 0
);
```

#### Issue 2B: Limited Keyword Coverage

Current `BIAS_KEYWORDS` in `biasAdjustment.ts` may be missing subtle patterns:

```typescript
'nostalgia bias': [
  'nostalgia', 'nostalgic', 'retro', 'throwback'  // Too explicit
  // Missing: 'takes me back', 'reminds me of my childhood'
],
'identity bias': [
  'as a non-binary person myself'  // Too specific
  // Missing: broader representation language
]
```

#### Issue 2C: Context-Insensitive Detection

Current system looks for keywords without understanding context or sentiment polarity.

### Proposed Solutions

#### Solution A: Lower Confidence Thresholds & Add Debug Mode

```typescript
// Temporary debug mode to see what's being filtered out
const DEBUG_BIAS_DETECTION = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

biasesDetected = biasesDetected.filter((b) => {
  const meetsThreshold = b.confidenceScore >= 0.15; // Lowered from 0.2
  const hasEvidence = Array.isArray(b.evidence) && b.evidence.length > 0;

  if (DEBUG_BIAS_DETECTION && !meetsThreshold) {
    logger.debug(`[BIAS DEBUG] Filtered out: ${b.name}, confidence: ${b.confidenceScore}`);
  }

  return meetsThreshold && hasEvidence;
});
```

#### Solution B: Enhanced Keyword Coverage

```typescript
const ENHANCED_BIAS_KEYWORDS = {
  'nostalgia bias': [
    // Explicit
    'nostalgia',
    'nostalgic',
    'retro',
    'throwback',
    'old school',
    // Subtle patterns
    'takes me back',
    'reminds me of',
    'back in the day',
    'like the good old days',
    'childhood memories',
    'grew up with',
    'first time playing',
    'when I was young',
  ],

  'identity representation bias': [
    // Current explicit
    'as a non-binary person myself',
    // Add broader patterns
    'as someone who',
    'speaking as a',
    'from my perspective as',
    'representation matters',
    'finally see myself',
    'characters like me',
    'authentic representation',
    'feels validating',
    'important to see',
  ],

  'franchise loyalty bias': [
    // Current
    'franchise',
    'series',
    'longtime fan',
    // Add subtle indicators
    'never disappoints',
    'always delivers',
    'trust this developer',
    'consistently great',
    'they understand',
    'knows what fans want',
  ],

  'subtle hype bias': [
    // Current obvious patterns
    'most anticipated',
    "everyone's talking about",
    // Add subtle hype language
    'finally here',
    'worth the wait',
    'exceeded expectations',
    'blown away',
    "couldn't put it down",
    'instant classic',
  ],
};
```

#### Solution C: Context-Aware Pattern Matching

```typescript
const detectSubtleBias = (text: string): BiasIndicator[] => {
  const indicators: BiasIndicator[] = [];

  // Pattern: Excessive positive language clustering
  const positiveWords = ['amazing', 'incredible', 'perfect', 'flawless', 'masterpiece'];
  const positiveCount = positiveWords.filter((word) => text.includes(word)).length;
  if (positiveCount >= 3) {
    indicators.push({
      type: 'hype bias',
      confidence: 0.6,
      evidence: `Cluster of ${positiveCount} strong positive descriptors`,
    });
  }

  // Pattern: Defensive language (sponsor bias)
  const defensivePatterns = [
    /not sponsored|not paid|my own opinion/gi,
    /just being honest|telling the truth/gi,
  ];
  if (defensivePatterns.some((pattern) => pattern.test(text))) {
    indicators.push({
      type: 'potential sponsored bias',
      confidence: 0.4,
      evidence: 'Defensive disclaimers may indicate undisclosed relationships',
    });
  }

  // Pattern: Comparison fatigue (reviewer fatigue)
  const fatiguePatterns = [
    /played so many|too many of these|another one/gi,
    /getting tired of|same old/gi,
  ];
  if (fatiguePatterns.some((pattern) => pattern.test(text))) {
    indicators.push({
      type: 'reviewer fatigue',
      confidence: 0.5,
      evidence: 'Language suggests reviewer burnout',
    });
  }

  return indicators;
};
```

#### Solution D: Sentiment-Context Integration

```typescript
const detectBiasWithSentimentContext = (
  text: string,
  sentimentScore: number,
  gameMetadata?: { releaseYear?: number; franchise?: string },
): BiasIndicator[] => {
  const indicators: BiasIndicator[] = [];

  // High score + franchise mentions = potential franchise bias
  if (sentimentScore > 8 && gameMetadata?.franchise) {
    const franchiseCount = countFranchiseMentions(text, gameMetadata.franchise);
    if (franchiseCount > 2) {
      indicators.push({
        type: 'franchise bias',
        confidence: Math.min(0.7, franchiseCount * 0.15),
        evidence: `${franchiseCount} references to franchise history with high sentiment`,
      });
    }
  }

  // New game + excessive praise = potential hype bias
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  if (
    gameMetadata?.releaseYear &&
    currentYear - gameMetadata.releaseYear < 1 &&
    sentimentScore > 9
  ) {
    indicators.push({
      type: 'hype bias',
      confidence: 0.6,
      evidence: 'Extremely high score for very recent release',
    });
  }

  return indicators;
};
```

## 3. Sarcasm Detection Issues

### Current Problem

The sarcasm detection produces generic, static responses:

- Always says "Sarcastic tone may flip apparent sentiment"
- Shows multiple evidence types but only lists 1-2 pieces
- Uses template text: "Sarcastic/satirical elements detected in review - these add entertainment value but don't affect score assessment"

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 3A: Template-Based Responses

```typescript
// In sentimentService.ts lines 1041-1080
satiricalBiases = sentiment.biasIndicators
  .filter((bias) => bias.toLowerCase().includes('sarcasm'))
  .map((bias) => ({
    explanation:
      "Sarcastic/satirical elements detected in review - these add entertainment value but don't affect score assessment", // STATIC
    evidence: ['satirical tone', 'ironic commentary', 'exaggerated reactions'], // GENERIC
  }));
```

#### Issue 3B: Evidence Mismatch

The system claims to find multiple evidence types but the "What tipped off the AI" only shows one example. This suggests:

- Evidence collection is working
- Evidence reporting is broken
- Evidence → explanation mapping is disconnected

### Proposed Solutions

#### Solution A: Dynamic Sarcasm Analysis

```typescript
const analyzeSarcasmDynamically = (
  text: string,
  detectedEvidence: string[],
  sentimentScore: number,
  gameTitle?: string,
): SarcasmAnalysis => {
  const analysis: SarcasmAnalysis = {
    type: 'occasional_sarcasm', // vs 'fully_satirical'
    intensity: 'mild', // mild, moderate, heavy
    purpose: 'unknown', // humor, criticism, emphasis
    affectsScore: false,
    dynamicExplanation: '',
    specificEvidence: [],
  };

  // Analyze evidence patterns
  const sarcasticWords = detectedEvidence.filter((e) =>
    ['brilliant', 'genius', 'obviously', 'clearly', 'perfect'].includes(e),
  );

  const hyperbolics = detectedEvidence.filter((e) =>
    ['amazing', 'incredible', 'revolutionary', 'mindblowing'].includes(e),
  );

  // Determine intensity
  if (sarcasticWords.length + hyperbolics.length > 3) {
    analysis.intensity = 'heavy';
  } else if (sarcasticWords.length > 1) {
    analysis.intensity = 'moderate';
  }

  // Determine purpose
  if (sentimentScore < 5 && sarcasticWords.length > 0) {
    analysis.purpose = 'criticism';
    analysis.dynamicExplanation = `Reviewer uses sarcastic language (${sarcasticWords.join(', ')}) to emphasize criticism. The negative sentiment aligns with sarcastic tone.`;
  } else if (sentimentScore > 7 && hyperbolics.length > 0) {
    analysis.purpose = 'emphasis';
    analysis.dynamicExplanation = `Reviewer uses exaggerated positive language (${hyperbolics.join(', ')}) for emphasis. This appears to be genuine enthusiasm rather than ironic criticism.`;
  } else {
    analysis.purpose = 'humor';
    analysis.dynamicExplanation = `Mixed sarcastic elements (${detectedEvidence.slice(0, 3).join(', ')}) suggest reviewer uses humor and irony as part of their style, but overall sentiment appears genuine.`;
  }

  return analysis;
};
```

#### Solution B: Context-Aware Evidence Reporting

```typescript
const buildDynamicSarcasmCard = (analysis: SarcasmAnalysis, allEvidence: string[]) => {
  // Match evidence categories to what was actually found
  const evidenceCategories = {
    sarcasticWords: allEvidence.filter((e) => SARCASTIC_WORDS.includes(e)),
    hyperbolicLanguage: allEvidence.filter((e) => HYPERBOLIC_WORDS.includes(e)),
    ironicPhrasing: allEvidence.filter((e) => IRONIC_PATTERNS.some((p) => e.includes(p))),
  };

  const foundCategories = Object.entries(evidenceCategories)
    .filter(([_, items]) => items.length > 0)
    .map(([category, items]) => `${category}: ${items.slice(0, 2).join(', ')}`);

  return {
    evidenceFound: foundCategories,
    whatTippedOffAI: allEvidence.slice(0, 3).join(', '), // Show actual evidence
    dynamicExplanation: analysis.dynamicExplanation,
  };
};
```

#### Solution C: Sarcasm Severity Classification

```typescript
const SARCASM_TEMPLATES = {
  light_humor: {
    explanation:
      'Reviewer uses occasional sarcastic remarks for humor while maintaining genuine critique.',
    scoreImpact: false,
    confidenceAdjustment: 0,
  },

  heavy_irony: {
    explanation:
      'Frequent ironic language suggests reviewer is using sarcasm to make strong points about the game.',
    scoreImpact: false,
    confidenceAdjustment: 0.1,
  },

  satirical_performance: {
    explanation:
      'Entire review appears to be satirical performance - score reflects actual opinion beneath the comedy.',
    scoreImpact: true,
    confidenceAdjustment: 0.3,
  },
};
```

---

## 4. Satirical Reviewer Classification Issues

### Current Problem

The `KNOWN_SATIRICAL_REVIEWERS` list is too broad:

```typescript
// Line 1372 in sentimentService.ts
const satiricalReviewers = ['zero punctuation', 'yahtzee', 'dunkey', 'videogamedunkey'];
```

This flags Dunkey's thoughtful reviews (like Last of Us Part II) as satirical when they contain genuine analysis.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 4A: Binary Classification

Current system: If reviewer is on the list → ALWAYS satirical
Reality: Some reviewers mix satirical and genuine content

#### Issue 4B: No Content Analysis

The system doesn't analyze whether THIS SPECIFIC review is satirical, just who made it.

### Proposed Solutions

#### Solution A: Reviewer Style Profiles

```typescript
const REVIEWER_PROFILES = {
  dunkey: {
    satiricalProbability: 0.7, // 70% of content is satirical
    genuineIndicators: [
      'serious analysis',
      'thoughtful critique',
      'genuine recommendation',
      'important to note',
      'in all seriousness',
    ],
    satiricalIndicators: [
      'masterpiece',
      'game of the year',
      'revolutionary',
      'completely changes everything',
    ],
    contextualFactors: {
      // Serious reviews tend to be longer
      longFormThreshold: 800, // words
      // Serious reviews mention specific mechanics
      technicalAnalysis: ['mechanics', 'gameplay', 'design', 'story'],
    },
  },

  yahtzee: {
    satiricalProbability: 0.95, // Almost always satirical
    escapeHatches: [], // Very rare genuine moments
  },
};
```

#### Solution B: Content-Based Satirical Detection

```typescript
const analyzeIfThisReviewIsSatirical = (
  text: string,
  reviewerName: string,
  sentimentScore: number,
): SatiricalAnalysis => {
  const profile = REVIEWER_PROFILES[reviewerName.toLowerCase()];
  if (!profile) {
    return { isSatirical: false, confidence: 0, reason: 'Unknown reviewer' };
  }

  let satiricalScore = profile.satiricalProbability; // Base probability

  // Adjust based on content analysis
  const genuineCount =
    profile.genuineIndicators?.filter((indicator) => text.toLowerCase().includes(indicator))
      .length || 0;

  const satiricalCount =
    profile.satiricalIndicators?.filter((indicator) => text.toLowerCase().includes(indicator))
      .length || 0;

  // Text length factor (for Dunkey - longer reviews tend to be more serious)
  const wordCount = text.split(' ').length;
  if (
    profile.contextualFactors?.longFormThreshold &&
    wordCount > profile.contextualFactors.longFormThreshold
  ) {
    satiricalScore *= 0.7; // Reduce satirical probability
  }

  // Technical analysis factor
  const technicalCount =
    profile.contextualFactors?.technicalAnalysis?.filter((term) =>
      text.toLowerCase().includes(term),
    ).length || 0;

  if (technicalCount > 3) {
    satiricalScore *= 0.5; // Strong technical analysis suggests serious review
  }

  // Adjust based on evidence
  satiricalScore += satiricalCount * 0.1 - genuineCount * 0.15;
  satiricalScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, satiricalScore));

  return {
    isSatirical: satiricalScore > 0.6,
    confidence: satiricalScore,
    reason: `Content analysis: ${genuineCount} genuine indicators, ${satiricalCount} satirical indicators, ${technicalCount} technical terms`,
    factors: {
      baseReviewerProbability: profile.satiricalProbability,
      contentAdjustment: satiricalScore - profile.satiricalProbability,
      wordCount,
      technicalAnalysisCount: technicalCount,
    },
  };
};
```

#### Solution C: Reviewer Intent Classification

```typescript
const classifyReviewerIntent = (text: string, metadata: ReviewMetadata): ReviewIntent => {
  // Multiple signals approach
  const signals = {
    satirical: 0,
    genuine: 0,
    mixed: 0,
  };

  // Signal 1: Language analysis
  const satiricalLanguage = countSatiricalLanguage(text);
  const genuineLanguage = countGenuineLanguage(text);

  if (satiricalLanguage > genuineLanguage * 2) signals.satirical += 0.3;
  if (genuineLanguage > satiricalLanguage * 2) signals.genuine += 0.3;

  // Signal 2: Structure analysis
  const hasDetailedAnalysis = checkForDetailedAnalysis(text);
  if (hasDetailedAnalysis) signals.genuine += 0.2;

  // Signal 3: Sentiment coherence
  const sentimentCoherence = analyzeSentimentCoherence(text, metadata.sentimentScore);
  if (sentimentCoherence > 0.8) signals.genuine += 0.2;
  if (sentimentCoherence < 0.3) signals.satirical += 0.3;

  // Signal 4: Recommendation clarity
  const hasClearRecommendation = checkForClearRecommendation(text);
  if (hasClearRecommendation) signals.genuine += 0.2;

  const maxSignal = Math.max(signals.satirical, signals.genuine, signals.mixed);

  if (maxSignal === signals.genuine) return 'genuine';
  if (maxSignal === signals.satirical) return 'satirical';
  return 'mixed';
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases Needed

#### Classic Game Detection

- Doom (1993) → Should be classic ✓
- Doom: The Dark Ages (2024) → Should NOT be classic ✓
- Zelda: Ocarina of Time → Should be classic ✓
- Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (2024) → Should NOT be classic ✓
- Skyrim (2011) → Should be classic ✓
- Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) → Should NOT be classic ✓

#### Bias Detection Sensitivity

- Subtle nostalgia: "This takes me back to playing the original" → Should detect
- Implicit franchise loyalty: "They really understand what fans want" → Should detect
- Defensive language: "Not sponsored, just being honest" → Should detect potential bias
- Identity representation: "Finally see characters like me" → Should detect

#### Sarcasm Analysis

- Light sarcasm + genuine review → Should show nuanced analysis
- Heavy satirical review → Should detect full satirical performance
- Mixed content → Should classify appropriately

#### Reviewer Classification

- Dunkey's Last of Us Part II review → Should NOT be flagged as satirical
- Dunkey's typical comedic review → Should be flagged as satirical
- Yahtzee review → Should almost always be satirical

### Transcript Examples

## Dunkey The Last Of Us Part II Review (Legit Review)

All good things come in twos. Jaws 2, Garfield 2, Knack 2. So obviously, Last of Us 2 was destined to be a masterpiece until the plot got leaked. Then the internet decided that this game was no good. These spoilers basically show you that the game is not worth buying. This game is shaping up to be a complete dumpster fire, dude. Like, people are canceling their pre-orders left and right. I won't be buying Last of Us 2. You have betrayed the fanbase. I don't even want to fucking play it anymore. And it's quite fitting that both Halo 5 is dogshit and so is Last of Us 2. It doesn't fucking matter if the game is out or not. The story is still dogshit. And this is why you have to actually play a video game before you start talking all that shit. Of course, these guys are small potatoes. Now me, I'm the dude off of Ratatouille. You can get past these guys, but the only way to get past me is to put Donkey Kong in the game. What sucks about always putting out great stuff is that people come to expect the impossible from you. The original Last of Us was a very good game and one that has been very influential on this generation of story-driven games. However, compared to this game, it is like a dog's chew toy. Uncharted 4 took Last of Us and slam-dunked it into the fucking garbage can. Bigger, more interesting story with better acting performances, better combat, music, puzzles, Crash Bandicoot, and all of these different types of traversal. So how do you top Uncharted 4? Well, you don't. In that game, you get a grapple hook. In Last of Us Part II, you open 150 filing cabinets. Uncharted is mysterious and exciting with a knockout ending. Last of Us is gross and horrific. It is a barrage of violence and screaming and cruelty, but it's also pretty damn fun. Naughty Dog continues to build upon their hide-and-seek style of combat. You can now crawl through grass, set traps, trick zombies into attacking your enemies, and headshot people with your silenced pistol. This isn't Metal Gear 5 levels of flexibility, but it's a far more game-like game than the original. Levels are massive with tons of branching paths. Some of the encounters in this game are so sprawling and complicated that they could be tackled in 20 different ways. Eventually, though, you are going to get caught. Enemies can spot you pretty easily, and that's when you gotta throw a molotov at somebody and run for cover. The less people searching for you, the easier it is to slip back into hiding. This is why I would often shoot everybody looking for me. The combat is fucking brutal. When you stab somebody, blood squirts out of their neck. The shotgun will just destroy someone's entire body. You have a bow and arrow that shoots dynamite. Enemies cry out for their fallen comrades and beg for their lives. It's all the grotesque gore that people desire from this type of game, taken to such a degree where you go... Jesus Christ! In a stroke of absolute genius, they have taken inspiration from the classic game Rogue Warrior. When Ellie kills somebody, she'll sometimes call them a swear word. Dick. Sleepy time, you fucking motherfucker. It can't live up to its mind-blowing E3 trailer, but this is easily one of the best-looking games out there. The story is heavily reliant on actors and animators alike to bring these characters to life, and they do some incredible work. We've seen all sorts of U.S. cities in video games. New York, Boston, San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, Los Angeles. Even New York is in some games. But it's cool to see a place I'm actually familiar with realized in a game of this caliber. Seattle. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bash Scramble Day. Hey, what the fuck? That's supposed to be Cheesecake Factory! This game is ruined. Blizzards and thunderstorms heighten the tension. Sunlight peers through windows of abandoned storefronts. Trees and currents tear through the city and reinforce imagery of life and beauty. Slowly rising out of this world of darkness. People aren't mad about graphics or gameplay, though. They're mad about the story. So what do I think about this story, huh? Heheheheheheh You wanna know what I think? Heheheheheheh It's a pretty good story. I haven't been this engaged by a video game story since Red Dead 2 and God of War. There are some bold twists in here. But they're all in service of a story that is still very faithful to the spirit of the original. This is a lengthy game that takes its time setting the stage and getting you invested in its characters. And then they all start killing each other. Turns out, we got bamboozled. You don't play as the giraffe. Instead, you play as a girl called Abby. And she kills Joel with a golf club. How are you gonna kill off the main guy? That's everybody's favorite guy! Honestly, I think Ellie should track down this Abby character and kill her. See how she likes it. Now that would be a good storyline. The truth is, I don't know why people are mad at this game because they don't know why they're mad. Fans are obviously very attached to Joel as a character and that's why killing him off is such a powerful way to ignite a revenge story. I don't know anything about this Abby person but you fucking kill Joel with golf of all sports? No way! I am coming to shoot this big dumb muscle bitch! And that's exactly what Ellie does. Like Uncharted, Last of Us 2 uses dual narratives to draw parallels and comparisons between its characters. Though instead of laying them on top of each other they're intersecting. Ellie's story is Uncharted 4 and Abby's story is Last of Us 1. Just like Nathan Drake's obsessive pursuit of treasure Ellie's suicidal revenge mission puts her friend's lives in constant danger and yet she keeps taking it further. Then, halfway through the game, everything resets. The clock turns back three days and now you play as the villain, Abby. Who is a hardened killer that starts to reconnect with her lost humanity thanks to the innocence of her child companion. Sound like anybody you know? It's obvious they're going to try and humanize and develop all these characters now looking from the other side and at first, you reject them. You go, fuck these guys. I don't care about them. They killed Joel with golf! Except for the dog. I like him. But as you keep playing eventually you find yourself getting wrapped up in their drama. The moment where they really got me was this sniper fight. This battle goes on for so long that you really come to hate this fucking sniper guy but by the time you reach him you realize wait a minute! No, I really like that guy! Ellie's side of the story is very focused and simple. Abby's side is messy and complicated with a bunch of new characters running around doing crazy shit in the middle of a war zone. It's very entertaining trying to connect the dots between both sides of the story and I imagine there's a lot of details you won't even catch until you go back and play through it again. A character you've already encountered as Ellie will show up in the back half of the game and you'll go, hey, I remember that guy! Good job! Characters will do things you won't agree with and you'll have to turn your brain on and attempt to empathize with them. In the world of Last of Us Part II one hateful act begets another but a selfless act can also be contagious. The story is not as airtight as Joel and Ellie's journey across the United States but conceptually this sequel is far more creative. So I give this game a 4 out of 5. Shut the fuck up, Leafy.

## IGN Dragon Age: Veilguard Review

As I excitedly slashed, blasted, wooed, looted, and delved my way through the stunning and enthralling world of Dragon Age The Veilguard, I kept having one thought. Wait, Bioware made this? 2024 Bioware? You're really selling it. With this game coming in the wake of the debacle that was Anthem, itself preceded by Dragon Age Inquisition and Mass Effect Andromeda, which were both merely alright in hindsight, I wasn't sure these former masters of the roleplaying game craft could make a game like this anymore. But putting together my team of interesting and endearing companions to save the world felt like getting the old band back together, in more ways than one. The scope of this adventure is the whole north of Thedas, sending you from the coasts of Ravain to the blighted wilds of the Anderfels as you attempt to prevent the rise of an ancient and menacing evil. It was thrilling, as a longtime fan of the series, to finally see so many of the places I'd only read about in a journal entry way back in 2009, and the way Bioware has us go about that exploration is very focused and deliberate. was one of the first things that jumped out at me, reminding me of the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic almost more than anything. The slick, looping corridors with just enough little nooks to discover are cleverly interconnected in a way that proves how a Bioware-style RPG gains a lot and loses almost nothing by ditching the idea of a fully open world. The exceptions to that are a couple of the more vertical sections of the city of Minrathus, which can be a little bit of a pain in the ass to navigate sometimes. Across the board, though, the environment art is really jaw-dropping, from the desolate peaks of Kal Sharaq to the surreal floating elven ruins in Arlathan Forest. I was very pleased with the character designs, too. The armor and outfits are fabulous, I spent more than an hour in the character creator, like I usually do, and came out with a version of our protagonist, Rook, who delighted me every time she was in frame. This might be some of the best-looking hair I've ever seen in a video game. Even with all of that visual splendor, I was able to get a stable 60fps at 4K on my RTX 3070 Super with DLSS set to maximum performance, which usually didn't affect the visual quality in very noticeable ways. The one exception to this was in the late game, when there could be so many spell effects going off at once that I'd not only lose frames, it's also just difficult to even see what's actually going on. Through the crackle and sparks, though, Veilguard's combat is definitely a refinement of what we saw in Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition. I've always preferred the more tactical style of Dragon Age Origins or Baldur's Gate 3, but that ship sailed so long ago for this studio, not even the Evanuris remember what it looked like. And so, judging this very action-focused combat system for what it is, it's pretty good. BioWare has committed fully to the fast-paced style and refined it to a point that I enjoy it quite a bit. And the ability to pause and issue party members orders, just like in Mass Effect, still gives some opportunity for more tactical players like myself to look around the battlefield and consider our next move. It definitely feels better on a controller than mouse and keyboard, though. I was somewhat disappointed that party members are more like extensions of your own character in combat at this point, rather than their own entities. They don't even have health bars, for instance. They can't be knocked out, whereas you instantly lose an encounter if Rook goes down. They do have equipment slots and skill trees, though less than what Rook gets. But overall, the amount of customization available for the whole squad through piles and piles of interesting, upgradable loot was more than enough to satisfy my RPG appetites, if not fulfill my wildest fantasies of intricate battle management. In my 100-hour, near-100%, almost obsessively completionist playthrough, I styled Rook as a Spellblade, a mid-ranged melee hybrid mage, and really enjoyed the playstyle once I'd unlocked all of my core tools. Dancing with a dagger through a lightning storm I summoned, darting out of danger and then back in for a lethal blow is just a really good time that rewards precise timing and wise target prioritization. This isn't the tactical Dragon Age of my youth, but it is a Dragon Age I can vibe with. And the highlights of combat are definitely the boss fights, which offer a really satisfying challenge even on the default difficulty. While standard mob fights with Darkspawn or Venatori cultists eventually got a little repetitive after 90-plus hours, going up against a high dragon never failed to get my blood pumping as I had to carefully study attack patterns and think on my feet. In the sense that a Bioware RPG is really about your companions, also known as the friends we made along the way, this might be the most Bioware game of all time. Not only is the whole squad made up of complex, memorable, likeable, distinct personalities from across Thedas, but they're all treated as the stars of their own story. Valeguard is light on that classic kind of side quest that's like, help bingo bongo find some nug grease. And I don't miss those much, because they've been replaced by full-length heroic arcs for each companion, with twists, turns, a personal nemesis, major character developments, and a moment of triumph fit for a protagonist rather than a sidekick. It's like the writers took the loyalty missions from Mass Effect 2 and blew them up into seven miniature games of their own. Almost every side mission ties into one of these, which obliterates the sense that you're just doing busywork. Picking a favorite of the seven Valeguard members to talk about genuinely feels like an impossible task. I really want to just say all of them are my favorite, but I had a rewarding romance with the stoic Grey Warden Davrin and became mother to his fledgling griffon pal, Ahsahn, so he's gotta be my pick for this playthrough. Ahsahn, that is. Seriously, if anything ever happens to this little guy, I will wash Thedas away in a tide of fire. The Vincent Price-inspired gentleman necromancer Emric is also a delightful twist on the usual edgy goth death mage tropes. And while we've been asked by the devs not to spoil specifically who I'm talking about As a non-binary person myself, Valeguard includes some of the most authentic representation of coming to terms with general gender stuff and having to navigate your family's reaction to it I've yet to see in a game. It doesn't feel like an after-school special or like I'm being pandered to. It's quite well handled, and finding out that the writer for this character is non-binary themselves did not surprise me at all. The larger plot that's threatening the world in the background as we're doing all these more personal quests is nothing particularly outstanding in its overall structure. We need to unite some factions to fight some evil gods who are trying to do bad things with tentacles. The major wrinkle that makes that interesting, however, is Solas, also known as the Dread Wolf, Fen'harel, the elven god of lies and rebellion, waiting in the wings, keeping me guessing about whether he was a friend or foe. As a continuation of the Dragon Age series, Valeguard does feel a little disconnected from where we left off a decade ago. If you were expecting decisions from previous games in the series to carry over, I'm sorry to say they've never mattered less. You only get to import three choices, one of which only comes up in the context of a single letter you may or may not find and read. You do get to recreate your Inquisitor from Dragon Age Inquisition, the same way Inquisition let you recreate your Hawk if you played Dragon Age 2, and the Inquisitor ends up being a fairly important character, which was cool. But things like who you chose to make the head of the Chantry at the end of Inquisition never come up. There's no sign of the Warden from Origins, even though you visit the stronghold of their order. Hawk gets only a passing mention. There are some other cameos from both Origins and Dragon Age 2, but those characters can conspicuously don't reference any important choices you may have made in their presence. This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot in a way, which was a bit paradoxically refreshing and disappointing at the same time. The pacing early on is kind of weird too, and I felt like I could practically smell the rewrites. For example, it's hilarious that no one ever says the word Veilguard out loud across the 100 hours I played of this dialogue-packed campaign, exposing a last-minute marketing pivot for what it is, but it doesn't take too long for things to get on a good track story-wise, and when they do, they stay on it. Aside from one huge choice you'll make early on, the most interesting bits of narrative design don't come up until the very end of Veilguard's story. And again, it's hard to dig into this too much without spoiling something, but the finale is also very much in the spirit of Mass Effect 2, which has an ending that up until now may have been the best series of complex, consequential choices ever featured in an RPG. The sacrifices I had to make in the closing hours hurt, the wise decisions I made paid off, and I even got the chance to dramatically flick an ace out of my sleeve at the very last moment, specifically because I took a very thorough and careful approach to everything leading up to that. It really felt like the ultimate reward. Throughout it all, the cinematic flair is off the charts, proving that BioWare is unmatched in the RPG world in that particular discipline. So much of the best stuff I can't even show you here, but parts of it felt like watching a big-budget fantasy movie in the best ways. A triumphant and effective, if not quite iconic, score elevates these moments further. Dragon Age The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years and leaves no doubt in my mind that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure. Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars. Taking out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale that's built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note.

## IGN Hogwarts Legacy Review

Leviosa. Leviosa. A levitation charm. Leviosa! Like many, I've been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. There have been some decent attempts, but none that come close to truly fulfilling the fantasy of receiving your own Hogwarts admission letter. With Hogwarts Legacy, I'm happy to say that magic has finally been captured. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It has spellcasting combat that's stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement, and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy's issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the wizarding world. Right in line with most Harry Potter tales before it, Legacy's plot has more holes than a fishnet stocking, and sorta just expects you to accept that its magical world makes no sense. This mystical action-adventure RPG begins with you transferring to Hogwarts as a fifth year, for unexplained reasons, to do everything from attending classes to fighting giant spiders. The fantastic character creator has plenty of options for you to craft your ideal witch or wizard, and as soon as you do they'll immediately become entangled in a conflict between the wizarding world and an evil goblin. On top of that, because being in a secret society of wizards is apparently not exciting enough, you soon discover that you've got some freaky supercharged magical abilities that allow you to do extra cool stuff that also isn't really explained. If you're like me, you'll roll your eyes while 100 years worth of dead characters lecture you from paintings about the important history and how you have to save the world or whatever. But once that's over with, Legacy mostly redeems itself with a fantastic cast of non-painting characters that help boil things down into a not-too-convoluted good guys vs. bad guys conflict that ends up being a largely enjoyable tale. You'll spend most of your time with the classmates who befriend you on campus, accompany you on certain quests, and help you hone your abilities as a magic user. Most are memorable and instantly endearing, like Sebastian the cocky and morally pliable Slytherin, or not Sly, the clever and unflappable Gryffindor. Spending time with them and improving my social links through their relationship questlines made my stay at Hogwarts all the more enjoyable. Unexpectedly, I even found myself looking forward to hanging out with my professors, whether it was my main man Professor Fig, who serves as both something of a mentor and as a sidekick, or the wise-cracking charms teacher Professor Ronan, who made me love him mostly by making fun of me. Each of these characters feels like an indispensable piece of the school, and you can find them wandering the halls doing their thing and choose to spend time with your favorites. It's a huge and important part of the Hogwarts fantasy that Legacy knocks out of the park. Even better, though, is the world itself, which is packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game and more. You'll find yourself wandering Hogwarts' stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, flying around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, and exploring dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. The developers at Avalanche have so brilliantly captured the look and feel of the wizarding world that I was amazed at just being there, no matter what trivial errand I was wrapped up in. That immersion could occasionally be broken by Legacy's dicey performance during my time playing on PlayStation 5, though. That includes framerate inconsistency, weird lighting issues, aggressive pop-in while moving around quickly, and more. There's even this weird thing where every door in Hogwarts has a brief loading screen. It's understandable since there's so much packed into this beast of an adventure, but the PS5's promises of the death of loading screens haven't quite been lived up to here. As someone who finds the wand-whipping fights in the movies fairly dull, I was very concerned that Hogwarts Legacy's spell-slinging combat wouldn't be able to hold my attention across the roughly 32 hours it took me to beat the campaign. But I can admit when I'm wrong, the combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. There's a lot more to it than shooting balls of light out of a stick. Instead, the trick is in dodging and countering enemy attacks while pulling off creative combos. For example, you can pull enemies toward you with Accio, light them on fire with the close-range Incendio, then blow them away with the explosive Bombarda spell. Chaining together abilities to make your opponents look like complete fools never stops being amusing, especially as you unlock talent tree perks that enhance your skills with modifiers that make your elemental spells fork to nearby enemies or transform into AoE attacks. Many of the combat encounters are legitimately challenging too. I'll admit I died my fair share of times while trying to show off a new set of spells or by neglecting to see a goblin sneaking up behind me. Improving your skills and figuring out which spells work best for you is a really entertaining process filled with experimentation and the occasional maiming. There's even a perfect parry mechanic which begs to be mastered by tryhards like me looking for that extra dopamine hit that comes from a timely block at the last possible second. You'll also be forced to change up your tactics regularly since many enemies have color-coded shields that can only be broken by spells of a particular type. For example, enemies with a red shield won't be damaged until you hit them with a fire-based spell, which means you'll need to keep a few of those handy. While the combat system never stops being entertaining, the creatures you fight do run out of tricks up their sleeves. You'll see the same familiar faces a lot as you spend an enormous amount of your time fighting dark wizards, spiders, and goblins. Every once in a while, they'll trot out a troll enemy or nondescript magical suit of armor as well, but the enemy's legacy throws at you can wear thin pretty quick. When you're not lighting spiders on fire, you'll need some lighter activities to spend your time with, and it's actually kind of crazy just how many side-tasks legacy gives you. You could spend hours decorating your very own personal space and the room of requirement, go around catching, grooming, and breeding all manner of fantastic beasts if you know where to find them, practice your gardening or potion making, go shopping in Hogsmeade, become a champion duelist in an underground dueling ring with your classmates, or even go full Voldemort and decide you want to become a master of the dark arts by learning the Killing Curse and other unspeakable acts, which goes about as well as you'd expect if you choose to pursue it. It's not just easy to waste hours goofing off. I found it downright difficult to not get distracted by a dozen things and forget what I'd originally set out to do. One of the ways you can completely forget about the looming goblin threat in the main story is by engaging in the over 100 side-quests that are packed into the adventure. Not all of these diversions are equally entertaining. Some are definitely your basic go here and kill or collect this thing errands that do little more than burn some time, but many feature one of the aforementioned awesome characters asking you to solve their problems or help them get into some good old fashioned mischief. It also helps that you're often appropriately rewarded for your efforts, whether that's earning some gear to upgrade your stats, cosmetic items to improve your swagger, or best of all, new spells. The ultimate carrot in a game where you're often limited only by what magic you know how to cast. For example, one side-quest gives you the Alohomora spell, which in classic metroidvania fashion allows you to literally unlock doors and get into places previously inaccessible to you. Upgrading spells goes a long way to opening up the map and giving you a better bag of tricks during combat, and I found myself positively thirsting for as many of these game-changing abilities as I could get my grubby paws on. The gear that you'll find doesn't really allow you to create full-on builds per se, but you'll gain some resistances and buffs to your character and can spend some time upgrading and modifying your best items for minor improvements. None of it is particularly game-changing stuff, but it managed to capture my attention enough for me to spend a good chunk of my time looking at my equipment. Of course, the real loot game is about the cosmetics, a fact that Legacy seems to be keenly aware of since they find ways to hide cool-looking clothes all over the place. These items don't have any gameplay impact, but pimping out my Slytherin legend to outshine all the kids from the lesser houses is more than enough of a motivation. Best of all, you can overwrite the appearance of any gear you've got equipped with the look of anything you've acquired so far, which is just fantastic. In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I've always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the wizarding world with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It's certainly weighed down by technical issues, an unexciting but inoffensive main story, and slim enemy variety, but even those couldn't come close to breaking the enchanting spell it cast on me.

## Fantasy Life I Review

SEEMINGLY BORN OF A DRUNKEN NIGHT BETWEEN ANIMAL CROSSING AND THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, FANTASY LIFE I, THE GIRL WHO STEALS TIME, IS THE LATEST TAKE ON BLENDING EASY-GOING LIFE SIMULATION AND DEEP DUNGEON DELVING. WITH ITS DANGEROUSLY BINGEABLE RPG MECHANICS AND SEEMINGLY ENDLESS SUPPLY OF CHARM, THIS COZY ADVENTURE STOLE PLENTY OF MY TIME, ALMOST WITHOUT ME EVEN NOTICING. THE CHARACTERS AND STORY ARE BOTH WONDERFULLY GOOFY AND MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN I'M USED TO SEEING IN THIS GENRE. THE PROCESS OF LEVELING UP YOUR VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL JOBS IS REALLY EASY TO GET LOST IN, AND IT ABSOLUTELY NAILS THE BALANCE BETWEEN SLICE OF LIFE COZY ACTIVITIES, VILLAGE BUILDING, AND ITS MORE ACTION-PACKED TASKS, SO I NEVER FOUND MYSELF BORED BY ANY OF THEM. AFTER MORE THAN 50 HOURS CHOPPING TREES AND SLAYING BOSSES, THIS HAS QUICKLY BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES OF THE YEAR. FANTASY LIFE I starts out as a pretty straightforward life sim, you're introduced to the job-switching life system in the first few hours, which then has you swapping between roles where you'll mine for ore, fish, and do favors for townsfolk. Just as I started to think, ah ok, I've seen this sort of thing before, it threw a curve ball into that formula in the form of a giant open world map full of brightly colored monsters to battle and puzzles to solve. Then just a few hours after that, it sent me to an island to build my own village, lulling me back into a false sense of understanding before once again pulling the rug out from under me by introducing roguelike dungeon crawling mechanics. This process of familiarity followed by delightful surprise repeats itself again and again, to the point where I was never sure what the next hour would bring, but what's more shocking is just how well many of these disparate activities work. It's usually a pretty big red flag when a game tries to cram this much in, as it risks spreading itself too thin and not doing any one thing particularly well, but by the time I found myself delving into procedurally generated dungeons filled with a mix of combat encounters and cozy activities reimagined as boss fights, like a fishing minigame against an extremely elusive megafish, I was in disbelief by how well Fantasy Life Eye pulled everything off. The more classic life sim stuff, like leveling up various career paths, doing errands for villagers in exchange for new furniture and money, and building up your own home to put all your stuff in, are mostly on par with some of the best in the genre. At the same time, the combat open-world exploration and RPG pursuit of new gear and skills may be quite simplified and mostly stress-free compared to full-on action-adventure games, but they're still engaging and have been nicely tuned to match the otherwise low-stakes sensibilities. Both halves work on their own, and it's all unified by a universally laid-back vibe. Fantasy Life Eye has a surprisingly full story involving time travel, dragons, magic, and the strange mysteries of a fantasy land called Reveria, where devoting yourself to one or more of the 14 jobs called Lives that have existed since time immemorial is a core part of their ancient culture. Alright! It's silly, over-the-top, and fairly predictable, but also much better written than I was expecting and had enough interesting moments to keep me invested throughout its fairly short runtime. The know-it-all archaeologist Edward is an entertaining companion to have at your side during the plot's most important moments, and a smarmy-mouthed bird named Trip never wears out his welcome with sassy banter as your sidekick. Hey! Watch it! The third act does drag a bit and ends in just about the most cliche way imaginable, but it's still more substantial and mostly successful in a genre where story is typically the last priority, if it's even a focus at all, so it was a nice change to see it leaned into here. Though you'll spend some of your time saving the world in the main story, much more of your attention will be paid to the day-to-day business of leveling up your skills and helping out the residents of Reveria. Like any good life sim, once you start the grind, it's quite difficult to put down as you leap from one profession to the other, unlocking new abilities, materials, and schematics as you go. The actual mechanics of doing all these cozy chores is nothing we haven't seen in plenty of other life sims. You'll catch bugs, reel in fish with a rod, and play a crafting minigame when it's time to put it all together, but it's all still oddly hypnotizing in just the right way, like how I can never seem to pull myself away from the mundane day-to-day of the sims. That said, the grind in Fantasy Life I is pretty intense, and I did find myself occasionally annoyed by just how many trees I was expected to chop down and vegetables I was asked to farm in order to make what I needed for the next mission or upgrade. It can be especially irksome when it comes time to craft it, since every crafting life has an identical minigame where you spam one button. You're also given a small patch of land and asked to fill it with homes for both you and the friends you make along the way, decorating and upgrading the homestead as you go. If you've played Animal Crossing, then you'll feel immediately familiar with this part of the formula, as it follows the script written by its peers almost to the letter. You'll craft furniture to customize your home, give fellow villagers gifts to improve your friendship and get goodies in return, and decorate the town to get a better ranking and unlock new things to add to your little community, like an art museum for your residents to peruse. This aspect is a lot more shallow than something like New Horizons. Residents don't have much unique dialogue, there aren't different weather or seasonal patterns, and there's far less to do when managing the quite compact area you're allowed to settle, but it's definitely still serviceable and a nice way to spend your time in between hard shifts at the smithing forge and adventuring out in the world. Fantasy Life I leans into the action-adventure-RPG side of things harder than I've seen in other hybrid life sims, with four of the fourteen lives devoted just to combat, all of which are chock-full of compelling abilities to unlock that make your battles easier. It's also pretty neat how the adventuring components feed right back into the life sim mechanics, encouraging you to return to town and craft a new sword or staff to improve your combat efficacy as you slay beasts and complete quests to advance these careers. There's not a whole lot to fighting beyond dodging, blocking, and spamming the same attacks, plus it's always very easy, but it's still nice to take a breather from collecting fruit and watering plants to slap around a giant red dragon for a while. The open areas you're let loose to explore are brimming with resources to collect, enemies to fight, and the rare, extremely light puzzle to solve. They are very effective as a more adventurous outlet after hours of crafting and chatting with townsfolk. You'll scale mountains to reach a rare mineral you saw glinting in the distance, chase down mimics filled with loot, and find little shrines that unlock companion characters when you complete their minigame, like a game of Simon Says or winning a timed boss battle. These companions will join your homestead and accompany you on your adventures, and are a really awesome addition to both adventuring and leveling up your life sim skills. You can have up to three tag along with you at a time, each of whom specializes in a life and will aid you in practicing it. There's also a very dope roguelike mode that cleverly reimagines what a procedurally generated dungeon can be in a game where most of your skills are gardening, fishing, and other disciplines that would seemingly be useless in a fight. These are no ordinary dungeons, as each node on their maps have a different life-related objective to be completed before you can move on to the next zone. One room might require you to gather each vegetable, while another may challenge you to fish every sea creature out of the waters before you can advance. And the whole map must be cleared within a time limit, so you've got to pick your battles when choosing what to collect and what to pass up on. While these levels are much more linear than the open world map, they also give you a much more predictable way to grind for XP and resources, and are an infinitely repeatable option once you've investigated every other nook and cranny. Like many life sim games, Fantasy Life I also has multiplayer that's unfortunately treated mostly as an afterthought. You can have friends or strangers visit your settlement to show off what you've built, but they aren't able to do a whole lot except look around. They can at least accompany you to one of the maps to assist with cozy activities or help you take down bosses in the open world, but for whatever reason, they force you to end the activity after a certain period of time, regroup, and launch again, which is just really odd. It's really nice to be able to adventure with friends, but in a game that nails most of what it attempts otherwise, this aspect definitely feels a bit barebones. Fantasy Life I, The Girl Who Steals Time, expertly combines easygoing life sim mechanics with light action RPG goodness, resulting in one of my favorite cozy games in a long time. Whether it's the compelling job grind while hanging around town, building your own community, or the more action-packed exploration and combat, I found myself continually surprised by what this adventure threw at me the longer I played. I was happily sinking hours into chopping down trees and picking flowers, and got oddly invested in its goofy but compelling story. As far as having your time stolen goes, you could do a whole lot worse than Fantasy Life I.

## IGN Astro Bot Review

I Can Now Die knowing that I've blasted bubbles of honey into the air using an elephant's trunk, jumped up on them to reach the top of a triple stack of chickens hiding in eggs, and then sucked the yolk out of said eggs using that same trunk. In other words, I Can Now Die happy. For 30 years, Sony has given us a vast library of top-quality PlayStation games, but there's never been a mascot platformer among them to rival the heights that Nintendo's Mario regularly reaches. Crash Bandicoot tried, Jak and Daxter had a decent run, even Knack had a go, bless him. Now though, a true contender has arrived. Packed with dozens of colourful levels and experimental abilities, Astro's latest outing thrusts him onto centre stage, joined by a supporting cast of PlayStation's past heroes to provide hours of pure joy. Bursting to the scenes with charm, Astro Bot is an inventive, nostalgia-fuelled platformer of the highest order. If 2020's Astro's Playroom was like a museum, albeit one with fun, playable exhibits, Astro Bot is like a theme park, throwing a new thrill at you around every corner and after every double-jumped gap. It doesn't always deliver the bonkers creativity that drives the likes of Super Mario Galaxy and Oddity, but that's hardly damning criticism when swings of that size are rarely taken outside of Nintendo's walls. What developer Team Asobi has designed here, though, does successfully evoke the spirit of those great platformers, by birthing novel stages full of visual flourish that never cross the line into becoming mere novelties. A handful of the many standouts are a time-bending casino, a Japanese bathhouse-inspired level with a humorous sponge system that's soaked in fun, and a smart level in which the floors and walls dynamically shift depending on whether a day or night button has been pressed. That last one in particular features a fantastic use of 3D space, while also feeling like a page torn straight out of the Fez playbook. Astro Bot really is the video game equivalent of venturing through Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, a delightful concoction of experimentation and joy, just without the child endangerment. Chocolate death pipes and fizzy lifting drinks are instead swapped out for sinkholes leading to treasure and an inflatable friend who helps you reach floating platforms. It even feels like some popping candy has smuggled its way into your controller, as it fizzes and pings away, sweetly reacting to whatever is happening on screen. Astro Bot is a showcase for the DualSense's bells and whistles, unlike anything since, well, Astro's Playroom at the PS5's launch. Triggers tighten in your fingers and rumbles are sent through your thumbs. Raindrops tickle your palms, and I found my whole body involuntarily drifting from side to side as I guided Astro's ship with the motion controls. And while there's nothing to quite rival the GPU earworm of 4 years ago, despite the best efforts of a giant singing tree, the music is a consistent delight throughout. The soundtrack scores levels that seem simple at first, but soon unfurl themselves to reveal tantalizing depths and secrets. Most are fairly linear, but some go the extra mile and are enjoyably knotty, providing sandbox-like areas to hunt for collectibles in. There's never the openness found in the large-by comparison Mario Odyssey levels, but enough nooks and crannies to get stuck into nonetheless. There are even whole extra levels to find within levels, with warp points hidden like buried treasure that jet you off to new locations in the lost galaxy. I'm a big fan of this Russian doll structure and the way it introduces new lands. It ensures a constant supply of surprises throughout Astro Bot's roughly 9-hour duration. And some of those biggest unexpected treats are the new powers that Astro gets along his journey. The basic movement of our little robot pal is great, with his jump, double jump and hover hitting that sweet spot between floaty and finely tuned. But it's the temporary abilities that come with each level that make things truly exciting. The twin frog gloves are a particular favorite, with their sticky tongues flinging out to provide a grapple swing option. They're also spring-loaded, meaning any incoming projectiles can be sent back from whence they came, exploding in an enemy's face. I also very much enjoyed the mouse mechanic, which reduces you down to a super small size, effectively turning on Toy Story mode that lets you clamber up oversized shelves and leaves in search of secrets. Even powers from previous Astro adventures are reinvented to great effect. For example, the monkey climber is an evolution of Playroom's climbing ability. But the assistance of a small robotic ape with huge hands this time means rocks can be hurled and ground pounded to great delight. Laurels are never rested on either, with new ideas and gadgets introduced right up until the final encore. Although some mechanics are reused a little more than I'd like, when such powers are recycled in later levels, they're thankfully recontextualized and given slightly new uses. Outside of bosses and mini-bosses, there initially doesn't appear to be a great range in enemy types. Sure, some are coated in different colors of paint or dressed to fit in with their surroundings, but they are all vanquished via the same few fundamental jump and hit combos. Later on though, the design book opens up and introduces some of my favorite foes. Those include an anthropomorphic playing card that flings a hand of clubs and spades your way, which you can then jump on to make your way towards the enemy to deal a killing blow of your own. Much friendlier faces can be found frequently though, over 150 of them in fact, as characters from PlayStation's vast library of games have made their way into Astro's world in the form of other bots. There are ones you'd expect, like Lombaxes, Tomb Raiders and a certain rapping dog, but Delightfully, some are plucked from the more obscure end of the scale. I'll let you discover those for yourself, and you'll never know where you'll find them either. For example, you'll rescue everyone's favorite tactical espionage action hero from the unfamiliar surroundings of Creamy Canyon, a dessert-based land dressed in sprinkles that's a far cry from the steel and snow of Shadow Moses. It's light touches of irony and slapstick humor like this that keep Astro's playful tone going throughout. It really is just a delight from start to finish in this regard. Many of the PlayStation characters appear as short, charming cameos, but a handful play fully-fledged supporting roles. I won't spoil who gets the star treatment here, aside from one, the previously revealed Kratos. His introduction sees you wield his ice-infused leviathan axe and take on the role of the exiled Spartan himself in a thrilling change of pace, the frosty blade boomeranging around the level. It's here where Astro Bot becomes truly magical, elegantly blending nostalgia with new ideas. Such moments essentially let you play these iconic games in miniature, lending Astro their powers and letting him loose in a level entirely built around familiar stories and settings, soundtracked by remixes of heroic themes. They're charming, and often the real highlight of the experience. I just wish there was one or two more of them, but perhaps I'm being greedy. It's clear from the very first frame of Astro Bot just how much love and reverence Team Asobi has for the history of Sony's consoles and their library of games. You choose a new save file by selecting one of three original PlayStation memory cards, and are then thrust into a scene taking place on your PS5-shaped mothership. In terms of story, well, it's light. That mothership crash-lands on a desert planet after an evil alien attack, and Astro must now travel the galaxy searching for its missing parts and crewmates. But a deep story isn't what you're here for, is it? Free from the now-standard PlayStation Studios themes of threatening apocalypses, familial woe, and coming-of-age pains, Astro Bot is all about following a cheery little metal bloke around on his adventures. That's not to say it won't spark an emotional response, though. Not through any great feat of nuanced writing, but when bumping into ghosts of PlayStation past and greeting them like an old school friend you haven't seen in a decade. The crash-site hub world has its own areas to explore and is packed full of quirks, such as eventually letting you customize your ship and outfit. The gacha machine mechanic makes a particularly enjoyable return, providing a satisfying way to spend the thousands of coins you'll collect. The way it builds out the hub with memorabilia and miniature dioramas for the PlayStation themed bots to adorably call home again proves a fun, tangible way of visualizing your progress through the adventure, rather than simply watching numbers tick up on a screen. It's not brand new for the series at this point, but still hits all the right spots. I arrived at the end credits after 9 hours, but had only collected 206 out of a possible 301 bots on my journey. There's plenty to do after the main levels are done, including finding the remainder of the crew, building out the rest of the hub base, and unearthing new secrets among the stars. There's so much in fact that it took me another 9 hours, so 18 in total to 100% Astro Bot, and acquire the Platinum Trophy that comes with it. While I'd never say any of its main worlds ever approach being truly difficult in the pursuit of that 100% completion goal, some enemies or obstacles did take a few tries. Thankfully, checkpoints are often generously and frequently located, meaning you're only ever moments away from the spot of your previous demise. An extra level of difficulty can be found in the semi-hidden trial-like stages, found by exploring among the overworld's stars though. These short sprints are littered with fast-moving objects, numerous enemies, and precise gaps to hop across that are designed to trip you up. Throw a complete lack of checkpoints into the mix as well, and these are easily some of the toughest tasks in Astro Bot, with a final level that's a real tough nu...

## VideoGameDunkey Legend of Zelda: OOT (Satire Review)

Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time is the worst game I have ever played in my life. Every aspect of the game was developed by monkeys, and it shows. As a follow-up to the NES hit Zelda II Link's Adventure, Nintendo wanted to approach this game with a more minimalist mentality. So on a shoestring budget of $14, Tengu Miyazaki got drunk and made this game in a weekend. But accidentally, Nintendo shipped the game into stores, forcing Nintendo into bankruptcy. So where do I start with a travesty like this? The controls range from floaty and imprecise to completely broken. Riding the horsey fucking sucks! The rhythm minigames are ripping off Guitar Hero. Just look at the walking! What the heck is wrong with you, Nintendo? And don't even get me started on the shooting, guys. Okay, that's it. You made me get star- The shooting is awful. Visually, though, the game is a masterpiece of sucking dick. This graphics looks like they blindfolded a retarded dolphin and said, Serve some dude! And threw him into a fucking box of crayons. If you touch those woman's tits, you'll die. Now look at a quality game. Notice how the graphics are very realistic. Now look at this goddamn abomination. This looks like gay Play-Doh. And there's no multiplayer. There's no multiplayer! Um, zero...

## VideoGameDunkey Dragon Quest: XI Review (legit review - but reviewer clearly mentions not being a fan of JRPG games, even though he liked his one - why is not not flagged?)

Everybody in the entire world hates RPGs. This is a universally accepted fact. So why would I ever subject myself to a game that nobody enjoys? Well, it has a funny blue guy. This is how I pick what games to play. Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age S Definitive Edition is a PlayStation 2 game with the combat of an NES game. You embark on an epic journey around the world assembling your party of heroes in an attempt to acquire the six Dragon Balls. If there was a program that could generate JRPGs automatically this would be the default product. You have your comedically over-the-top voice acting. What?! That's ridiculous! You have a guy who gets amnesia. You have people getting mind-controlled. You have a cringeworthy stripper character in a game aimed at children. All of this stupid shit is here. But what sets Dragon Quest apart is its restraint. It's not going for insane twists. It's more about taking time to set up these episodic scenarios and then slightly challenging your preconceptions. Turns out, and this is gonna blow your mind, turns out you are the chosen one. Yeah, the Luminary. And only you can save the world. I know, that's pretty crazy. I think this is the first game to do that. The protagonist is a stupid purple dumbass who can't talk and needs a haircut. The true main character is actually Sylvando who is a circus performer that helps you fight a gigantic sandworm and then you have to defeat him in a big horse race. Also, he is the gayest man of all time. Good morning, darling! I'm talking Mondo gay. You know what I'm saying? He's like a big, loud-ass gayzilla. Oh! He sails around the world with a naked muscle dude and then dresses you up like a peacock and starts leading a gay pride parade so that he can go beat the shit out of a dragon with a speech impediment. Sylvando is as awesome as he is obnoxious. There is also a grandpa character who is a magic wizard but is also a master of karate and is also the king. Also, he likes to have a porno magazine. For me, Dragon Quest XI is two games of varying quality duct-taped together. The first half, which is a lot of fun and the second half, which is grindy and kind of lame. For the fun half of the game, I would walk around these scenic landscapes and fight a monster every time I discovered a new one. The enemies of Dragon Quest are by far the best part about the series. The slimes! Oh, the slimes! How can you not love these guys? Just, it's so cute! Ah! Monsters! They even turned him into a controller. It's the worst shit I've ever seen. Look at the toe! Look at the- Look at- He's- Ha ha ha ha ha! The- The bat! Oh, the bat! He is so goofy. Come on, you gotta give it up for these bats. Pluck, pluck, pluck! How you not gonna like- Pluck, pluck! Come on! Pluck, pluck! Oh, but then you gotta stump chump, ladies and gentlemen. You have masterful characters like Fun Ghoul and Devilman that jumps out of a treasure chest. It's the animation that really brings them to life. Look at this crazy motherfucker called Cruelcumber. He's a big-ass cucumber and when you beat him, his spear flies into the air and impales him. Not only are there no random encounters in this game, the enemies in the world are so easily avoided that who you fight is entirely in your hands. I would go into a dungeon with 70 monsters and fight maybe six of them just to see the new enemy designs and this playstyle was completely valid until the certain point when I hit the octopus boss. He just did not give a fuck about me. He started one-shotting every guy in my party on every single attack. This is where Dragon Quest said to me, No, you are playing this game wrong. This is now World of Warcraft. Go and grind XP for three hours. In the back half of the game, the pacing is slowed down to the point of tedium. You are going to hear this song... a lot. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Is it over? Can I... Can I walk? ♪ I can understand the laid-back appeal of this type of combat where you just sit back on the couch, you know, tap a button and breeze through enemies but the shit is beyond excessive. The game would be so much more enjoyable if you just fought 10 or 15 tougher enemies and then go on to the boss instead of having to farm hundreds of punching bags that present zero threat. It is so blatant about wasting your time. Let's say I need a thousand XP to level up. Well, how much is this guy worth? 2 XP. What about old platypunk? 8 XP. 5 XP. Whoa, now this guy's pretty big. 25 XP. Come on now, what about Bongo Drongo? 33 XP. 35. 20. 22. 37. Then you run into a metal slime. Wanna know how much he's worth? 2010 XP. Who the fuck makes this game? Dragon Quest XI is toothless and charming. I wanted more beautiful music, more wacky characters and less filler combat. It's 25 hours worth of game stretched out to 40. It kind of sucks, but on the other hand, you can fight a guy called Booga. I love it and I hate it, so I guess I'll just barely give this one a 3 out of 5. Just out of respect for Booga.
