# Scorelytic Documentation

## Overview

Scorelytic analyzes video game reviews (YouTube, critics, creators) to extract sentiment, detect bias, and provide both raw and bias-adjusted scores. The platform is transparency-first: users see how scores are shaped, not just the final number.

## Sentiment & Bias Pipeline

- **analyzeText()**: Extracts a synthetic sentiment score (0-10) and bias indicators from review transcripts using LLMs.
- **evaluateBiasImpact()**: Pure TypeScript function that takes the sentiment score and bias indicators, applies heuristics, and returns a bias-adjusted score, breakdown, and rationale.

## API Usage

```ts
import { analyzeText } from 'server/src/services/sentimentService';
import { evaluateBiasImpact } from 'shared/utils/biasAdjustment';

const sentiment = await analyzeText(transcript);
const biasAdjustment = evaluateBiasImpact(sentiment.sentimentScore, sentiment.biasIndicators);

// Result includes:
// - sentimentScore (synthetic, platform-owned)
// - biasAdjustedScore
// - biasImpact[] (with severity, influence, explanation)
// - adjustmentRationale
// - audienceFit
```

## UX & Transparency

- **Toggle**: Users can switch between raw sentiment and bias-adjusted scores.
- **Rationale**: Every adjustment is explained neutrally‚Äîno moralizing.
- **Platform as arbiter**: Scorelytic owns the synthetic score, not the critic. All reviews are analyzed equally.

## Extending to Critics

- Critic reviews are treated as transcripts. If an explicit score is present, it can be compared to the synthetic score for extra context.

## üåê Frontend Routes (SEO-Friendly)

| Route Pattern                     | Description                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `/`                               | Homepage with latest games and updates  |
| `/games/:gameSlug`                | Game profile with reviews and ratings   |
| `/creators/:creatorSlug`          | Creator profile with bio and reviews    |
| `/reviews/:creatorSlug/:gameSlug` | Detailed review page for a creator/game |

---

## üöÄ SEO & UX Considerations

- **SEO-friendly slugs:** Human-readable, unique slugs for all games and creators
- **Rich metadata:** Use Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD
- **Performance:** Optimize images and enable code splitting
- **Canonical URLs:** Prevent duplicate content via canonical tags
- **Internal linking:** Improve engagement and crawlability
- **Shareability:** Enable sharing of reviews via social platforms
- **URL design:** Avoid query params in public routes

---

# Testing Strategy

- Use **Jest** with **ts-jest** for testing API routes and utility functions.
- Use **React Testing Library** for testing React components.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., Supabase, OpenAI) using `jest.mock()`.
- Place tests in a `__tests__` folder colocated with the code being tested.
- Write descriptive test names covering happy paths and basic edge cases.
- Run all tests with `npm test` at the repo root (runs both server and client tests)
- All backend code is under `server/src/` for TypeScript rootDir consistency

---

## üì¶ Additional Notes

- Ensure slug uniqueness in the database
- Fallback routing for incorrect/missing slugs ‚Üí 404 or redirect
- Cache popular pages and aggregated scores
- Keep documentation updated with all changes to APIs or routing

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Internal Dashboard (LLM QA & Review)

- Internal-only tool for reviewing, validating, and overriding LLM sentiment analysis results.
- Features:
  - Grouped and advanced QA views
  - Human-in-the-loop overrides (saved to Supabase)
  - Color-coded legend for mismatches/overrides
  - CSV download, search, and filters for unreviewed/overridden
- Fully covered by Jest + React Testing Library tests (see README for test instructions)

## üß† LLM Sentiment Analysis (Backend)

- Utility: `analyzeTranscript(transcript: string, reviewId: string): Promise<{ summary, sentimentScore, verdict }>`
- Sends a transcript to an LLM (OpenAI, live), parses the response, and updates the review's sentimentSummary field in the DB.
- Sentiment result fields:
  - `summary: string` ‚Äî short summary of the review sentiment
  - `sentimentScore: number` ‚Äî score from 0‚Äì10
  - `verdict: string` ‚Äî e.g. "positive", "negative", "mixed"
- Returns null/empty for missing fields (no hallucination)
- Fully tested with Jest and supabase mocks.

## üì∫ YouTube Transcript Analysis Pipeline

- Captions are fetched from YouTube videos and stored as `review.transcript`.
- Each transcript is analyzed by the LLM (OpenAI), producing:
  - `summary`, `sentimentScore`, `verdict`, `sentimentSummary`, `biasIndicators`, etc.
- Results are stored in the DB and surfaced in the internal dashboard for QA and override.
- The same data powers the public-facing game/creator pages and analytics.

## Bias-Adjusted Review Output (Multi-Layered)

### Data Models (Types)

See `shared/types/biasReport.ts` for:

- `ReviewSummary`: User-facing, quick verdict and score, with confidence and bias summary.
- `BiasDetail`: List of all detected biases, their severity, score impact, and qualitative effect.
- `CulturalContext`: Explains how cultural/ideological context may affect perception and score.
- `FullBiasReport`: Internal, diagnostic output for transparency and audit.

### API Endpoint

`POST /api/review/bias-report`

- **Input:** `{ sentimentScore: number, biasIndicators: string[] }`
- **Output:** `{ summary, details, culturalContext, fullReport }` (see types above)

### React Component

`BiasReportViewer` (see `client/components/review/BiasReportViewer.tsx`)

- Collapsible sections for each output layer
- Tailwind CSS for styling
