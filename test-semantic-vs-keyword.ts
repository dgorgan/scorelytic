Then the internet decided that this game was no good. People are canceling their pre-orders left and right. 
I wasn't going to buy Last of Us 2. These spoilers basically show you that the game is not worth buying.
This game is shaping up to be a complete dumpster fire.

But then I actually played the game for myself. And this is why you have to actually play a video game 
before you can review it. The Last of Us Part II is actually a pretty good game. 
I think it's flawed but I enjoyed my experience with it.
